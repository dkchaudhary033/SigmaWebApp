        <p>
            Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal developer of the
            Linux kernel, which is the kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control
            system Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science at the
            University of Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then, the
            Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in the world, powering everything from
            smartphones to supercomputers.
